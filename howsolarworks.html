			<b>Solar panels</b>
			<p>
			The term solar panel is used colloquially for a photo-voltaic (PV) module.
			A PV module is an assembly of photo-voltaic cells mounted in a framework for installation. 
			Photo-voltaic cells use sunlight as a source of energy and generate direct current electricity. 
			A collection of PV modules is called a PV Panel, and a system of Panels is an Array. 
			Arrays of a photovoltaic system supply solar electricity to electrical equipment.

			<b>Charge controller</b>
			<p>
			A charge controller, charge regulator or battery regulator limits the rate at which electric current is added to or drawn from electric batteries. 
			It prevents overcharging and may protect against overvoltage, which can reduce battery performance or lifespan and may pose a safety risk. 
			It may also prevent completely draining ("deep discharging") a battery, 
			or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery technology, to protect battery life. The terms "charge controller" or "charge regulator" may refer to either a stand-alone device, 
			or to control circuitry integrated within a battery pack, battery-powered device, or battery charger.

			<b>Battery system</b>
			<p>
			A battery management system (BMS) is any electronic system that manages a rechargeable battery 
			(cell or battery pack), such as by protecting the battery from operating outside its safe operating area[clarification needed], 
			monitoring its state, calculating secondary data, reporting that data, controlling its environment, authenticating it and / or balancing it.
			A battery pack built together with a battery management system with an external communication data bus is a smart battery pack. 
			A smart battery pack must be charged by a smart battery charger.

			<b>DC power</b>
			<p>
			Direct current (DC) is the one directional or unidirectional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime example of DC power. 
			Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. 
			The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.
			The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean simply alternating and direct, as when they modify current or voltage.
			Direct current may be converted from an alternating current supply by use of a rectifier, which contains electronic elements (usually) or electromechanical elements (historically) 
			that allow current to flow only in one direction. Direct current may be converted into alternating current via an inverter.

			<b>Inverter</b>
			<p>
			A power inverter, or inverter, is a power electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC).
			The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power handling depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry. 
			The inverter does not produce any power; the power is provided by the DC source.
			A power inverter can be entirely electronic or may be a combination of mechanical effects (such as a rotary apparatus) and electronic circuitry. 
			Static inverters do not use moving parts in the conversion process.
			Power inverters are primarily used in electrical power applications where high currents and voltages are present; circuits that perform the same 
			function for electronic signals, which usually have very low currents and voltages, are called oscillators. 
			Circuits that perform the opposite function, converting AC to DC, are called rectifiers.

			<b>AC power</b>
			<p>
			Instantaneous power in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the circuit. In alternating current circuits, 
			energy storage elements such as inductors and capacitors may result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow.
			The portion of power that, averaged over a complete cycle of the AC waveform, results in net transfer of energy in one direction is known as 
			active power (more commonly called real power to avoid ambiguity especially in discussions of loads with non-sinusoidal currents). 
			The portion of power due to stored energy, which returns to the source in each cycle, is known as instantaneous reactive power, 
			and its amplitude is the absolute value of reactive power.
